    Oh, there you are! This is the first time we've met, isn't it?
    So let me tell you a story...<br><br>

    Once upon a time, two friends were studying magic with the most powerful magician of their time...
    As they came of age, they were each blessed by two entities, each the most powerful in its category: one, magic itself, and the other, draconic magic. As for their master, following the announcement of the end of their apprenticeship, he decided to isolate himself from the world because, according to him, he had nothing more to contribute to it.<br><br>

    Our two protagonists became the highest ranking members of the council of the city of the Syrian islands, thanks to their compassion and their always fair and benevolent judgment towards the people. They were respected and adored by all.<br><br>

    Life went on peacefully in this city where magic and technology went hand in hand, all the more so thanks to the EDEN generator which made it possible to supply the city's homes with magic, in order to allow those who could not master it to live properly.<br><br>

    But one day, a war broke out within the city. A group of people wanted to use the technology and power of the generator to transcend their human condition, and thus no longer fear death.<br><br>

    The council of the city decided to rise against them. Our two heroes, being members of this council, found themselves facing their former teacher, who was leading this army. The latter had become jealous of his disciples and their power.<br><br>

    He had decided to use EDEN to become immortal. However, this one not being foreseen for this kind of use, he began to tear and interlace the dimensions, creating a breach. Our two disciples witnessed the madness of their former master, who was leading the world to its ruin.<br><br>

    During a fierce battle between disciples and master in front of the generator, the experience and power of the master was felt. The disciples, now close to defeat, decided to destroy EDEN in a final combined attack.<br><br>

    The reactor destroyed, the rift became unstable and, in a huge magical explosion, the island disappeared, along with all its inhabitants...<br>

    ...all but one person, who in spite of himself had obtained immortality.<br><br>
